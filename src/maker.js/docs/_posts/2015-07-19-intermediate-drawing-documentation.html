<p>
    Hi Makers, <br />
    Another chapter of documentation is ready! Check out <a href="/docs/intermediate-drawing/#content">Intermediate Drawing</a>, which
    will walk through the next level of drawing concepts with plenty of examples and JSFiddles that you can experiment with. This doc concludes
    with the simple yet powerful technnique of modifying "foreign" models.

    Thanks,<br />
