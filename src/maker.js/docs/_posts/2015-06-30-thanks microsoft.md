title: Thanks Microsoft!
---

A big thank you goes out to the [Microsoft Garage](http://microsoft.com/garage) for the inspiration and encouragement to get Maker.js out here into the open source world. Shout outs go to Ed Essey, Jeff Ramos, and Anne Legato for the support and the [great news article](https://news.microsoft.com/features/latest-microsoft-garage-releases-break-new-ground-for-do-it-yourselfers-note-takers-and-more/) that features a too-large picture of myself.

This was the Garage's first (and definitely not last) open source delivery, so I learned a lot along the way. I thought that launch day would be the end of the work, but now I see there is a new chapter ahead, about delivering the message of how this library can help makers. I still have a lot of documentation to write, so please be patient. My stance is that the documentation is equally as important as the code, when it comes to getting new developers started.

Mostly I'm glad that Maker.js is now public, it's actually a lot easier to work in the open. Things like NPM publishing and mobile device testing add extra steps when a repo is private.

Back to the documentation!

Thanks,
Dan
