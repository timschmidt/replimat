title: A laser cut business card
---
<p>
I recently attended the <a href="http://2015.cascadiajs.com"/>2015 CascadiaFest conference</a>. It was an inspiring event with
great talks and great folks. I wanted generate some interest around Maker.js, so I thought I'd "print" up a few business cards.
If you were at the conference, maybe you got one of these:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/makerjs-card.jpg" />
<p>
In case you can't tell, I themed this business card like a toy model car kit - the kind where you break away the plastic pieces.
I used the current <a href="https://github.com/danmarshall/makerjs-logo">model code for the logo</a> and I needed to create a
whole <a href="https://github.com/danmarshall/makerjs-monotext">new stencil font</a> to add the URL you see in the picture.
The font is incomplete, and only has the letters for "makerjs.org" but its a good start, and ripe for contributors to jump in ;-)

Head over to the <a href="http://maker.js.org/demos/#content">demos page</a> and look for "card" in the dropdown
and customize your own version.
