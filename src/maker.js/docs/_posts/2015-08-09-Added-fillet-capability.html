title: Added fillet capability
---
<p>
    I'm happy to announce the new fillet feature! Now you don't have to do your own trig and geometry to add fillets to your drawings.
    There are two types of fillet functions that have been added: <a href="/docs/api/modules/makerjs.path.html#fillet">traditional fillet</a> and CNC-specific
    <a href="/docs/api/modules/makerjs.path.html#dogbone">dogbone fillets</a>.
</p>

    Thanks!<br />
