title: Layers
---

<p>
    Layers are a way of logically grouping your paths or models as you see fit. Simply add a <code>layer</code> property to any path or model object, with the name of the layer.
    Every path within a model will automatically inherit its parent model's layer, unless it has its own layer property. As you can see in this example, a layer can transcend the logical grouping boundaries of models:
</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
//render a round rectangle with arcs in their own layer

var makerjs = require('makerjs');

var roundRect = new makerjs.models.RoundRectangle(100, 50, 10);
roundRect.layer = "layer1";

roundRect.paths.BottomLeft.layer = "layer2";
roundRect.paths.BottomRight.layer = "layer2";
roundRect.paths.TopRight.layer = "layer2";
roundRect.paths.TopLeft.layer = "layer2";

var svg = makerjs.exporter.toSVG(roundRect);

document.write(svg);

{% endhighlight %}

<script>
    LiveDoc.evalLastCode();
</script>

<i>Layers are not visible in this example but they logically exist to separate arcs from straight lines.</i>

<p>
    A layer name can be any string. Furthermore, you can use a reserved color name from this list to get an automatic stroke color when your model is exported in DXF or SVG:
    <br/>
    aqua, black, blue, fuchsia, green, gray, lime, maroon, navy, olive, orange, purple, red, silver, teal, white, yellow
</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
//render a round rectangle with arcs in their own color layer

var makerjs = require('makerjs');

var roundRect = new makerjs.models.RoundRectangle(100, 50, 10);
roundRect.layer = "layer1";

roundRect.paths.BottomLeft.layer = "red";
roundRect.paths.BottomRight.layer = "red";
roundRect.paths.TopRight.layer = "blue";
roundRect.paths.TopLeft.layer = "blue";

var svg = makerjs.exporter.toSVG(roundRect);

document.write(svg);

{% endhighlight %}

<script>
    LiveDoc.evalLastCode();
</script>

<hr />

<p>
    Layers will be output during the export process in these formats:
    <ul>
        <li>DXF - paths will be assigned to a DXF layer.</li>
        <li>SVG - in continuous mode, a new &lt;path&gt; element will be created for each layer.</li>
        <!--li>OpenJsCad - extrusion depth can be specified by layer.</li-->
    </ul>
</p>
