title: Modifying models
---

<p>
    We know that models are relatively simple objects with a well known recursive structure.
    This allows us to modify them for different purposes. Let's modify and combine two different models
    in one drawing.
</p>

<p>
    For this example we will use ovals to make an oval L shape. We begin by creating a model function that has two ovals:
</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
//render two ovals which overlap

var makerjs = require('makerjs');

function ovalL(width, height, thickness) {
    var ovalH = new makerjs.models.Oval(width, thickness);
    var ovalV = new makerjs.models.Oval(thickness, height);

    this.models = {
        h: ovalH, v: ovalV
    };
}

var svg = makerjs.exporter.toSVG(new ovalL(100, 100, 37));

document.write(svg);
{% endhighlight %}

<script>
    LiveDoc.evalLastCode();
</script>

<p>
    There are overlapping arcs in the lower left corner. We can remove them if we know their id and position in the
    heirarchy. There are several ways we can inspect this model, here are a few:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Look at the code which created it. This may involve deep lookups. For example, the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/maker.js/blob/master/src/models/Oval.ts">Oval source code</a>
        references the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/maker.js/blob/master/src/models/RoundRectangle.ts">RoundRectangle source code</a>.
    </li>
    <li>Use the browser's console, or JavaScript debugger to set a breakpoint in your model.</li>
    <li>Use the browser's DOM inspector to traverse the rendered SVG.</li>
    <li>Output the raw JSON or SVG on screen.</li>
    <li>Use the Playground app and click "show path names".</li>
</ul>

<p>
    By looking at the source code we know that an Oval is a RoundRectangle and that the ids for arcs are <i>BottomLeft</i>, <i>BottomRight</i>, <i>TopLeft</i> and <i>TopRight</i>.
    The ids for the sides are <i>Left</i>, <i>Right</i>, <i>Top</i> and <i>Bottom</i>. Also, we need to note the orientation of these lines so we know which are origin and end points.
</p>

<p>
    To remove a path we use the JavaScript <b>delete</b> keyword:
</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
//render two ovals which overlap

var makerjs = require('makerjs');

function ovalL(width, height, thickness) {
    var ovalH = new makerjs.models.Oval(width, thickness);
    var ovalV = new makerjs.models.Oval(thickness, height);

    //delete the lower arcs from the vertical oval
    delete ovalV.paths.BottomLeft;
    delete ovalV.paths.BottomRight;

    //delete the inside arc of the horizontal
    delete ovalH.paths.TopLeft;

    this.models = {
        h: ovalH, v: ovalV
    };
}

var svg = makerjs.exporter.toSVG(new ovalL(100, 100, 37));

document.write(svg);
{% endhighlight %}

<script>
    LiveDoc.evalLastCode();
</script>

<p>
    The next step is to eliminate the overlap in the lines. Here are two approaches to do this:
</p>

<p>
    Adjust only the x or y component of the point:
</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
//render an L shape, modifying points by their x and y

var makerjs = require('makerjs');

function ovalL(width, height, thickness) {
    var ovalH = new makerjs.models.Oval(width, thickness);
    var ovalV = new makerjs.models.Oval(thickness, height);

    delete ovalV.paths.BottomLeft;
    delete ovalV.paths.BottomRight;
    delete ovalH.paths.TopLeft;

    //move the x of the horizontal's top
    ovalH.paths.Top.end[0] = thickness;

    //move the y of the vertical's right
    ovalV.paths.Right.origin[1] = thickness;

    this.models = {
        h: ovalH, v: ovalV
    };
}

var svg = makerjs.exporter.toSVG(new ovalL(100, 100, 37));

document.write(svg);
{% endhighlight %}

<script>
    LiveDoc.evalLastCode();
</script>

<p>
    Share a point on both lines:
</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
//render an L shape, sharing a point

var makerjs = require('makerjs');

function ovalL(width, height, thickness) {
    var ovalH = new makerjs.models.Oval(width, thickness);
    var ovalV = new makerjs.models.Oval(thickness, height);

    delete ovalV.paths.BottomLeft;
    delete ovalV.paths.BottomRight;
    delete ovalH.paths.TopLeft;

    //set to the same point
    ovalH.paths.Top.end =
        ovalV.paths.Right.origin =
            [thickness, thickness];

    this.models = {
        h: ovalH, v: ovalV
    };
}

var svg = makerjs.exporter.toSVG(new ovalL(100, 100, 37));

document.write(svg);
{% endhighlight %}

<script>
    LiveDoc.evalLastCode();

<p>
    Let's progress this example further, by modifying an L shape into a C shape. Create a new model function for C, and immediately create an L within it.
    The C may create a new <i>models</i> object for itself, and nest the L inside; alternatively, C can just assume L's <i>models</i> object:
</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
//render an L with an oval over it

var makerjs = require('makerjs');

function ovalL(width, height, thickness) {
    var ovalH = new makerjs.models.Oval(width, thickness);
    var ovalV = new makerjs.models.Oval(thickness, height);
    delete ovalV.paths.BottomLeft;
    delete ovalV.paths.BottomRight;
    delete ovalH.paths.TopLeft;
    ovalH.paths.Top.end =
        ovalV.paths.Right.origin =
            [thickness, thickness];
    this.models = { h: ovalH, v: ovalV };
}

function ovalC(width, height, thickness) {

    //assume the same models as L
    this.models = new ovalL(width, height, thickness).models;

    //add another oval
    this.models.h2 = new makerjs.models.Oval(width, thickness);

    //move it to the top
    this.models.h2.origin = [0, height - thickness];
}

//using C instead of L
var svg = makerjs.exporter.toSVG(new ovalC(100, 100, 37));

document.write(svg);
{% endhighlight %}

<script>
    LiveDoc.evalLastCode();
</script>

<p>
    Just as before, we need to delete the overlapping paths using the <b>delete</b> keyword. Let us also make a short alias for <i>this.models</i> to save us some keystrokes:
</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
//render an L and form a C

var makerjs = require('makerjs');

function ovalL(width, height, thickness) {
    var ovalH = new makerjs.models.Oval(width, thickness);
    var ovalV = new makerjs.models.Oval(thickness, height);
    delete ovalV.paths.BottomLeft;
    delete ovalV.paths.BottomRight;
    delete ovalH.paths.TopLeft;
    ovalH.paths.Top.end =
        ovalV.paths.Right.origin =
            [thickness, thickness];
    this.models = { h: ovalH, v: ovalV };
}

function ovalC(width, height, thickness) {

    //set local var m for easy typing
    var m =
        this.models =
            new ovalL(width, height, thickness).models;

    m.h2 = new makerjs.models.Oval(width, thickness);
    m.h2.origin = [0, height - thickness];

    //delete overlapping arcs again
    delete m.h2.paths.TopLeft;
    delete m.h2.paths.BottomLeft;
    delete m.v.paths.TopRight;
}

var svg = makerjs.exporter.toSVG(new ovalC(100, 100, 37));

document.write(svg);
{% endhighlight %}

<script>
    LiveDoc.evalLastCode();
</script>

<p>
    Lastly, we need our overlapping lines to meet at a common point. Notice that the new oval <i>h2</i> has a different origin the the previous ovals.
    So, we must <b>originate</b> for all of the ovals to share the same coordinate space. Afterwards, we can assign the common point to both lines. 
</p>
<p>
    In the Play editor, try removing the call to originate to see the results without it.
</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
//render a C shape

var makerjs = require('makerjs');

function ovalL(width, height, thickness) {
    var ovalH = new makerjs.models.Oval(width, thickness);
    var ovalV = new makerjs.models.Oval(thickness, height);
    delete ovalV.paths.BottomLeft;
    delete ovalV.paths.BottomRight;
    delete ovalH.paths.TopLeft;
    ovalH.paths.Top.end = 
        ovalV.paths.Right.origin = 
            [thickness, thickness];
    this.models = { h: ovalH, v: ovalV };
}

function ovalC(width, height, thickness) {
    var m = 
        this.models = 
            new ovalL(width, height, thickness).models;
    m.h2 = new makerjs.models.Oval(width, thickness);
    m.h2.origin = [0, height - thickness];
    delete m.h2.paths.TopLeft;
    delete m.h2.paths.BottomLeft;
    delete m.v.paths.TopRight;
    
    //h2 has paths relative to h2 origin, 
    //we need to originate to share the point
    makerjs.model.originate(this);
    
    //share the point
    m.h2.paths.Bottom.origin = 
        m.v.paths.Right.end =
            [thickness, height - thickness];
}

var svg = makerjs.exporter.toSVG(new ovalC(100, 100, 37));

document.write(svg);
