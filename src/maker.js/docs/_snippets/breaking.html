title: Breaking paths
---

You can break paths into two pieces if you have a point that lies on the path (from an intersection, for example) by using <a href="/docs/api/modules/makerjs.path.html#breakatpoint">makerjs.path.breakAtPoint</a>.
This function will change the path that you pass it, so that it is broken at that point, and it will return a new path object which is the other broken piece:

{% highlight javascript %}
//break a path in two

var makerjs = require('makerjs');

var model = {
  paths: {
    arc: new makerjs.paths.Arc([0, 0], 50, 0, 180)
  }
};

var arc2 = makerjs.path.breakAtPoint(model.paths.arc, [0, 50]);
makerjs.model.moveRelative(arc2, [-10, 0]);

model.paths.arc2 = arc2;

var svg = makerjs.exporter.toSVG(model);

document.write(svg);
{% endhighlight %}

<script>
    LiveDoc.evalLastCode();
</script>

For Circle, the original path will be converted in place to an Arc, and null is returned.
