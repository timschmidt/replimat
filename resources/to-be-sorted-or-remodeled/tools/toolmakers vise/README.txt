# Summary

This is a small desktop vise which may be used for a wide variety of clamping and fixturing tasks. The design is based on the classic toolmaker's vise, which allows for a wide range of travel without the need for a long threaded rod. Despite its small size and plastic construction this vise is capable of producing surprisingly high clamping force, and is adequate for tasks such as holding work in a drill press. This design also maintains good parallelism between the vise jaws, even when clamping oddly-shaped objects. 

A 1/4-20 x 2" socket-head cap screw, as well as a matching washer and hex nut, are required in addition to one copy of each of the printed parts. 

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: MakerGear
Printer: M2
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: Yes
Resolution: 0.2mm
Infill: 25% +

Notes: 
The vise jaw should be rotated 90 about the y-axis from it's default orientation for best results. 

# Post-Printing

## Assembly

The 1/4-20 hex nut should be pressed into the vise nut, and the corresponding metal washer should be pressed into the vise washer. The vise wrench component may optionally be pressed onto the head of the 1/-20 SHCS.
