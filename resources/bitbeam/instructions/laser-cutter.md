# Making Bitbeams With Basswood On a Laser Cutter

You can buy 5/16" x 5/16" basswood dowel at some art stores - with a little
laser cutting, this is an easy way to make bitbeam.

## 1. Making a Stencil

The holes in bitbeams need to be precisely lined up - the easiest way to
do this is to make a 'stencil' form, with grooves to hold the bitbeams in
place. We can laser cut this out of a flat piece of wood or cardboard.

## 2. Cutting Dowels to length

Now you have a stencil, you need to cut the dowels to length, to fit the
holes. You can either use a saw for this, or the laser cutter.


## 3. Cutting the Holes

Fill the grooves in the stencil with the pieces if dowel. Now make sure that
the stencil is lined up precisely with the corner of the laser cutter. The
next file is designed to drill holes in precisely the center of the dowels.

Once the laser has finished, you need to flip each piece over 90 degrees and
print the holes again.
